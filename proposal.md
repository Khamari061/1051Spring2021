## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Comic Quest

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")



## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will be creating this project using python to code. Our software will take user inputs and return scenarios based on their input. Our project will function using While loops, nested if/else statements, and reading files. Our project will also account for incorrect/invaild imputs. The project will also enable the player to restart the game if they wish to.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Accepting user inputs and returning a scenario that allows them to continue until they have reached the end. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Incorperating images based on the scenario.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Incorperating audio and sound affects

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
